    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that focuses on organizing and structuring code around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP aims to represent real-world entities and their interactions through the use of objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goals of OOP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP promotes the organization of code into self-contained modules called classes. Each class encapsulates data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to a specific entity or concept. This modularity makes code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: OOP emphasizes code reuse by allowing classes to be used as blueprints to create multiple objects with similar characteristics. Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, inheriting their attributes and behaviors. This promotes efficient code reuse, reduces redundancy, and enhances productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP supports encapsulation, which means bundling data and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (a class). Encapsulation provides data hiding and abstraction, allowing the internal implementation details to be hidden from other parts of the program. This enhances security, improves code maintainability, and reduces dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: OOP enables abstraction by focusing on essential characteristics and behaviors of objects while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction simplifies the complexity of a system by providing a high-level view and allowing developers to interact with objects based on their essential features. It helps in modeling real-world entities and promotes clearer code design.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface. Polymorphism enables code flexibility, extensibility, and the ability to write generic code that can work with objects of different types. It promotes code reuse and enables dynamic behavior based on the actual type of the object at runtime."

    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In Python, an object is a fundamental concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that represents a specific instance of a class. An object is created from a class and inherits its attributes and behaviors. It is a self-contained entity that combines data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object can be thought of as a real-world entity or concept that can be represented in code. For example, if we have a class called \"Car,\" an object of that class could represent a specific car with its own unique characteristics such as color, model, and mileage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects are created by calling the class as if it were a function, which invokes the class's constructor method (\"__init__()\"). The constructor initializes the object's attributes and sets its initial state."

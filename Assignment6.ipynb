    "\n",
    "# 1. Use descriptive variable names that clearly describe the purpose or meaning of the value they store.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Variable names should be in lowercase letters. For example, count, name, age, etc.\n",

    "# For example: total_count, is_student, user_name, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Avoid using single letter variable names like x, y, and i. While they may be acceptable in certain situations, it's generally better to use more descriptive namesa as it will conveying the purpose of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Maintain consistency in variable naming throughout the codebase. Using the same naming conventions and styles across your project will ensure uniformity and avoid confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Follow PEP 8 guidelines as it is the official style guide for Python code. It provides recommendations for naming conventions and coding styles. According to PEP 8, variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores. It also suggests using descriptive names and avoiding single-character names except for certain cases like loop counters.\n",
